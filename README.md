🏦 Customer Credit Risk Prediction & Decision Support System

A machine learning + AI-powered decision analytics project that predicts **customer credit risk**, provides **real-time alerts**, and generates **business insights** through an interactive dashboard.  

This project was inspired by the **Decision Analyst role at Barclays**, focusing on **data-driven decision making, advanced analytics, and risk management**.

## ✨ Features

- **Risk Scoring (ML Models)**  
  Predicts probability of default for customers using structured data (transactions, demographics, loan history).  

- **AI-Powered Insights**  
  Uses GPT-5 for extracting sentiment & risk signals from unstructured customer feedback.  

- **Real-Time Alerts**  
  Flags high-risk customers instantly when thresholds are crossed.  

- **Historical Trend Analysis**  
  Visualizes changes in customer risk over time (month/quarter).  

- **Interactive Dashboard**  
  Built with Streamlit (or Flask/Django + React/HTML), showcasing:  
  - Risk distribution  
  - Key drivers (feature importance, SHAP values)  
  - Alerts panel  
  - Trend charts & reports
